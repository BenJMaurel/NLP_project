### Data

We have put directly the .npy files corresponding to the feature extractions of each layer of the ROBERTA-base model. You can find them in the drive provided for this purpose at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nhwBmUW-fo12kIPIX9mrGt2X8nWvekvy?usp=sharing. You can find the embedding of sst-2 train, sst-2 test, news20, trec and wm16.

To use these files in colab's notebook, it is necessary to create a shortcut to your drive (right click on the folder then add a shortcut)

## Credits
